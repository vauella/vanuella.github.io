## Unblock Yourself to Me
*(© Vanuella Watt 2012)*

::: {.lyrics}
That you love me,  
That you need me,  
That you miss me,  
Oh my love,  
Take a while,  
Think of me…  

**Chorus:**  
Unblock yourself to me  
Unblock yourself to me  
Tell me that you love me forever  
That we'll find a way to each other  
Tell me that you'll come back to me, love  
And I promise I will be there  

I taste the life, without you by my side,  
I feel the pain, running through my veins  
But my love, I can't breathe  

Can you see me,  
Can you feel me,  
Can you hear me,  
Oh my love,  
You must please,  
Forgive me

## Angel
*(© Vanuella Watt 2012)*

::: {.lyrics}
I feel your power invading me  
I wanna feel these miracles  
I was frozen now I am so hot  
I'm losing my sense of control  

**Chorus:**  
Angel, I am calling your name man  
I need to feel you now  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Angel, I am calling your name man  
I need to feel you now  

I need to believe you're real  
Make myself feel eternity  
I wish I can breathe you now  
I wanna feel I am divine
